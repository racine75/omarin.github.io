        <p>
          My teaching philosophy emphasizes active learning, clarity, and the integration of 
          real-world systems into the classroom. I strive to make computer science both rigorous 
          and engaging, ensuring that students not only master the theory but also gain hands-on 
          skills that prepare them for research, industry, and innovation.

      <h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        I use interactive board work, kinesthetic classroom activities, and debate-style 
        discussions to make abstract concepts tangible. Students are encouraged to collaborate, 
        ask questions, and reflect critically on what they learn. My goal is to help them 
        see computer science as both a science and an engineering discipline.

      <h2>Mentorship</h2>
      <p>
        I supervise senior projects and capstone theses, guiding students through both 
        theoretical explorations and practical implementations. I have mentored projects on 
        authentication systems, AI-enhanced software design, distributed consensus, and 
        blockchain applications.

      <h2>Public Outreach</h2>
      <p>
        In addition to my university teaching, I give public presentations aimed at making 
        computer science concepts accessible to wider audiences. These talks are designed for 
        non-specialists and emphasize clarity and real-world relevance. Past audiences have 
        included high school students, teachers, local policymakers, business professionals, 
        and the general public.
      </p>
