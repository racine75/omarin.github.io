        My research lies at the intersection of distributed algorithms and systems implementation, 
        with a focus on building resilient and scalable infrastructures. I am particularly interested 
        in how emerging technologies such as data processing units in modern datacenters, reinforcement 
        learning in multi-agent systems, and quantum resources for distributed coordination reshape 
        the classical challenges of fault tolerance, consensus, and performance. Across these projects, 
        my goal is to develop theoretically grounded algorithms that remain practical and impactful 
        in real-world environments.

        <h3>Frugal Distributed Algorithms at the Network Layer (FrugalDiNet)</h3>
        <p><strong>Funding:</strong> French National Research Agency (ANR, 2024–2027)<br>
           <strong>Collaborators:</strong> Three French partner institutions</p>
        <p>
          This project investigates how intelligent hardware, such as programmable switches and 
          Data Processing Units (DPUs), can be leveraged for high performance services in large-scale 
          datacenters. My focus is on identifying exploitable telemetry and designing distributed 
          algorithms that enhance scalability and resilience at low cost. The work aims to establish 
          a foundation for next-generation network devices attuned to the performance demands of 
          modern infrastructure.

        <h3>Scalable Collective AI: Learning and Decision-Making in Multi-Agent Systems</h3>
        <p><strong>Funding:</strong> National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC, 2025–2028)<br>
           <strong>Collaborators:</strong> <a href="https://mlauriere.github.io/">Dr. Mathieu Lauriere</a>, NYU Shanghai</p>
        <p>
          This project investigates the intersection of artificial intelligence, reinforcement learning, 
          and mean-field game theory to understand how large populations of agents learn, adapt, and 
          cooperate in complex environments. The research combines rigorous mathematical modeling with 
          computational experimentation: mean-field games provide a framework for analyzing equilibrium 
          behavior, while scalable algorithms are designed and tested to handle thousands of interacting 
          agents. My contribution focuses on distributed simulation and algorithmic implementation, 
          developing architectures that enable large-scale experiments, validate theoretical results, 
          and extend them into tractable methods with applications in economics, finance, and network 
          optimization.

        <h3>QUANTum Improved COnsensus (QUANTICO)</h3>
        <p><strong>Status:</strong> Exploratory project<br>
           <strong>Collaborators:</strong> <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/chandrashekar/home">Dr. Chandrashekar Radhakrishnan</a>, NYU Shanghai</p>
        <p>
          This collaboration examines the potential of entanglement to accelerate coordination in 
          distributed quantum systems. We have introduced formal models that capture the interplay 
          of quantum resources with communication delays and used them to design new approaches for 
          leader election and consensus. Our findings suggest that quantum resources can significantly 
          reduce complexity, but that delays remain fundamental, reframing classical impossibility 
          results in the emerging context of hybrid quantum–classical computing.
